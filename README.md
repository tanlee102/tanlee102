Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a passionate developer from Vietnam, dedicated to independently creating high-quality products. I have a deep love for coding, video editing, content writing, watching anime, playing chess, and football. I enjoy learning new things and documenting my journey to expand my knowledge ðŸ“š. While I have a strong desire to travel, I'm currently focused on building my career. I'm actively seeking job opportunities and remain hopeful about finding the right role soon!

ðŸ“§ Feel free to connect with me: lequoctanre@gmail.com
